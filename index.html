    <p>Fish tacos make for a very fresh and quick dish. Fun to eat and fun to make, they are a more authentic Mexican staple 
        that one could enjoy and are versatile enough that eating them never gets boring.

    <h3>Tofu in tomato sauce</h3>

    <p>
        Tofu in tomato sauce is one of my favorite Vietnamese foods. It has a nice mix of spice and sweetness, and texturally is balanced
        between crispy tofu and a smooth sauce.

    <h3>Scrambled eggs</h3>

    <p>
        Scrambled eggs are what I eat to start my day. They, like tofu in tomato sauce, have a nice balance between textures and 
        flavors, and are quite versatile.
