    <p>Fish tacos make for a very fresh and quick dish. Fun to eat and fun to make, they are a more authentic Mexican staple 
        that one could enjoy and are versatile enough that eating them never gets boring.

    <p>
        Tofu in tomato sauce is one of my favorite Vietnamese foods. It has a nice mix of spice and sweetness, and texturally is balanced
        between crispy tofu and a smooth sauce.
